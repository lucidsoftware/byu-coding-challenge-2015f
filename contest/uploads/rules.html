	<h3>Participation</h3>
	<div class="rule-body">
		This contest is open to all college students.
		Each team may consist of at most three members.
	</div>

	<h3>Materials</h3>
	<div class="rule-body">
		Each team will be provided 1 computer and sufficient writing materials.
		<br>
		No electronic devices (calculator, cell phone, etc), books, or notes are permitted.
		<br>
		The computers will use Linux. We will attempt to accomodate requests for Windows machines.
	</div>

	<h3>Problems</h3>
	<div class="rule-body">
		There will be 8-10 problems, varying in difficulty. The problems will focus on reasoning, critical thinking, and algorithmic problem solving. For each problem, you will be provided a description, the format of input, the format of output, samples, and a (generous) time limit for your solution.
		<br>
		You will have 4 hours to solve as many of the problems as you can, in whatever order you wish. After two hours, a brief hint will be given for each problem.
		<br>
		Clarification may be requested about the problems. Each problem has been reviewed for clarity and correctness, so it is unlikely that any futher information will be needed. However, if an ambiguity or error is discovered, all contestants will be notified.
		<br>
		Official solutions will be available <a href="/BYU2015F/embed/solutions/">here</a> after the contest.
	</div>

	<h3>Submissions</h3>
	<div class="rule-body">
		Your submission will consist of your source code, which must be in one file.
		<br>
		Submissions may be made in many languages, including C++03, Java 6, NodeJS 0.8.11, Python 2.7, and Python 3.2. All standard libraries are available for use.
		<br>
		Input will be provided through the standard input, and output should be printed to standard output.
		See <a href="/BYU2015F/embed/samples/">samples</a> for further instructions.
	</div>
	   
	<h3>Judging</h3>
	<div class="rule-body">
		Submissions are tested when they are received, and the outcome will be available to the submitting team. If the submission is incorrect, one of the following reasons will be given:
		<ul>
			<li>Compile-time error</li>
			<li>Run-time error</li>
			<li>Time limit exceeded</li>
			<li>Wrong answer</li>
		</ul>
		Well-written code will be easier for your team to debug, but your code will judged on its output, not its style.
		<br>
		Scoring is by the number of problems solved.
		<br>
		Ties are broken by time. A team's time is calculated as the total for each correctly solved problem of
		<ol>
			<li>The time taken to solve the problem (as measured from the beginning of the contest).</li>
			<li>Twenty minutes for each incorrect submission for the problem.</li>
		</ol>
		(Note that incorrect submissions of unsolved problems do not contribute to this total.)
