# BYU Coding Challenge Fall 2015

## SPOJ

You can find the hosted [problem descriptions](http://www.spoj.com/BYU2015F/problems/contest/) and [final rankings](http://www.spoj.com/BYU2015F/ranks/) on SPOJ. If you are logged in (under any account), you can click a rank or submission number to see the submitted source code.

The problems are open for submission on the public SPOJ site (www.spoj.com/problems/FOO, instead of www.spoj.com/BYU2015F/problems/FOO).

## Solutions and test data

To see the test data and official solutions, see the [`problems/`](problems) directory in this repo. Each subdirectory has a README.md that summarizes the solution to the problem. Check the `solutions/` and `test/` directories for additional solutions, and the SPOJ inputs and outputs.
